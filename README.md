# Real Comparison of Backbone + Marionette App vs Angular

### Original Post + App is here: http://tutorialzine.com/2013/04/services-chooser-backbone-js

#### This is a Rails App (but the Rails part does virtually nothing)
#### Backbone Code is located in -> app/assets/javascripts/backbone/app.js.coffee

### TODO:
* Add plugins for Collection Selection to automated the isSelected part (like Angular does)
* Add plugin for 2-way-data-binding which automates manually updating the price (like Angular does)
* Do screencast for [BackboneRails.com](http://www.backbonerails.com) 
* Taking this terrible 1-pager and then convert to real MCV application structure (with separation of concerns)
* Talk about functional bits on iterating on a collection, applying a filter, and then plucking attributes of models
