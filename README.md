# Professional Comparison of Backbone + Marionette App vs Angular

### Original Post + App is here: http://tutorialzine.com/2013/04/services-chooser-backbone-js

#### This is a Rails App (but it does virtually nothing)
#### Backbone Code is located in -> app/assets/javascripts/backbone/app.js.coffee

### TODO:
* Add plugins for Collection Selection to automated the isSelected part (like Angular does)
* Add plugin for 2-way-data-binding which automates manually updating the price
* Do screencast on taking this and then converting to a real application (with separation of concerns) and real MVC structure
* Talk about functional bits on iterating on a collection, applying a filter, and then plucking attributes of models
